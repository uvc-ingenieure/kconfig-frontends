Authors of kconfig-frontends.

The developers of the Linux kernel are the original authors of the kconfig
parser and frontends. The list is too long to reproduce here, but you can
get a pretty complete list from the Linux kernel repository logs:
    git shortlog scripts/kconfig

The packaging uses the CMake tools.

The initial packaging was done by:
    "Yann E. MORIN" <yann.morin.1998@free.fr>
	
The Windows port was done by:
	"Max Holtzberg" <mh@uvc.de>

For a complete list, see the commit-logs of the kconfig repository.
